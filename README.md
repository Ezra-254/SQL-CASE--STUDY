Museums Open on Sunday and Monday:
The query finds museums that remain open on both Sunday and Monday by linking data from the museum_hours and museum tables. It ensures both days are covered with a HAVING clause, providing a list of museums open at the start and end of the week.

Longest Operating Museum:
By calculating the difference between opening and closing times (converted to timestamps), the query identifies the museum with the longest operating hours, showing which museum offers the most access to visitors on a given day.

City and Country with Most Museums:
This query aggregates museum data by country and city, helping to determine the geographical concentration of museums. It provides valuable insights into where most museums are located, highlighting the cities with the highest museum counts.

Most and Least Popular Painting Styles:
The query helps to identify the most and least popular painting styles by counting how often each style appears in the artist table. The results allow us to understand which styles are in demand and which are less common.
